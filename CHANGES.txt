Changes
=======

2.8 (unreleased)
----------------

- Nothing changed yet.


2.7 (2012-05-02)
----------------

- Include grokcore.chameleon. Have the generated index view template be
  a chameleon based template.

2.6 (2011-05-26)
----------------

- There was an inconsistency where the various logfiles we placed. Fixed the
  situation by using the intended "{buildout}/var/log" location throughout.

- Remove the ``log`` and ``data`` part stubs that were left for backwards
  compatibility. Deprecation period is over. NOTE: if you are to update an
  existing project by replacing your ``buildout.cfg`` with that of a newly
  generated project, please make sure there is no important data ``data`` and
  ``log`` subdirectories left!

2.5 (2011-02-02)
----------------

- Better checks and tests for faulty project names.

2.4 (2011-01-20)
----------------

- z3c.testsetup has been removed in favor of manual registration of tests.
  Tests have been moved to 'tests' subdirectory.
  See tests.py for more information on how to register tests.

- The 'static' directory is no longer grokked and registered as a
  DirectoryResource. It has been superseded by `fanstatic`_.

  In order to update your current grok project to the most recent grokproject,
  you need to register a fanstatic Library for the `static` directory.

  Include the following code in ``resource.py``::

    from fanstatic import Library
    library = Library('$name_of_your_project', 'static')

  in the setup.py of your project, add the following entry point::

    'fanstatic.libraries': [
        '$name_of_your_project = $name_of_your_project.resource:library',
    ]

  Also add `zope.fanstatic` and `fanstatic` to `install_requires` in your
  setup.py. If you are using z3c.autoinclude in your configure.zcml, the
  registrations of zope.fanstatic will be picked up automatically. If you
  do not use z3c.autoinclude, include zope.fanstatic in your configure.zcml.

- Split up zope.conf into zope.debug.conf and zope.deploy.conf, in order to
  pick these up from the paster configs debug.ini and deploy.ini.

  In debug/devmode, grok picks up changes in page templates and fanstatic
  recalculates resources URLs.

  In non-dev/deploy mode grok caches page templates and fanstatic caches
  resource URLs.

  The goal is to quickly see the difference between debug.ini and deploy.ini
  without having to mess around in parts/etc.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org

2.3 (2011-01-10)
----------------

- Use 'extensions +=' instead of 'extensions =' to be able to define extensions
  in other cfg files we extend.

- Added include_site_packages, install_requires, and additional_grants
  variables in the template for use in dolmenproject.
  Use vars and template_main parameters in main function so it can be reused
  in dolmenproject.

2.2.1 (2011-01-05)
------------------

- The accesslogging filter in deploy.ini was lost and refound.

2.2 (2010-11-26)
----------------

- `unzip=true` default behavior in buildout.cfg.

- Added 'daemon' part to the newly created buildout.cfg.

- Work around '-S' bug in virtualenv.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/virtualenv/+bug/572545

2.1 (2010-10-26)
----------------

- **NOTE: As a result of these changes, ``grokproject`` will no longer
  support building projects based on Grok versions earlier than 1.2!**

- Removed the ``--grokversion`` and ``--grok-release-url`` commandline
  options, in favor of the ``-version-url`` option. This URL should point to a
  buildout ``*.cfg`` file containing version "pins" for all the packages
  involved. The default URL is still looked up by way of
  http://grok.zope.org/releaseinfo/current.

- The newly created project will use the test layer and test browser from
  ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer``.

- Delegate bootstrapping a newly created project to the project's
  ``bootstrap.py`` and the project's ``bin/buildout``. This isolates the
  bootstrapping from grokproject itself and prevents potential zc.buildout
  version conflicts.

- Update to use z3c.recipe.scripts instead of zc.recipe.egg as part of the
  upgrade to zc.buildout-1.5.2.

2.0.1 (2010-05-30)
------------------

- Make sure the otherwise empty log and extends-cache directories exist.

2.0 (2010-05-30)
----------------

* Use a pipeline for setting up the application.

* Add logger ``grok`` in ``debug.ini`` and ``deploy.ini``
  templates. This logger logs warning messages emitted by more recent
  versions of grokcore.view template registry (and has no effect
  with older grok versions).

  By default warning messages are displayed in ``debug.ini`` and
  disabled in ``deploy.ini``.

  To change settings, edit section ``[logger_grok]`` in
  ``etc/debug.ini.in`` and ``etc/deploy.ini.in`` respectively and
  rerun buildout afterwards.

* Use a new "version information" layout on http://grok.zope.org/releaseinfo.

  More specifically, the "bundlemaker" or "eggbasket" feature is no longer
  used. Instead, grokproject expexts to find a
  http://grok.zope.org/releaseinfo/[y.x]/versions.cfg file and a
  http://grok.zope.org/releaseinfo/[y.x]/eggs directory containing
  distributions for all the dependencies of grok.

  This "eggs" directory is used by way of the ``find-links`` directive in the
  ``buildout.cfg`` of newly created projects.

  The ``versions.cfg`` file extends the groktoolkit files that in turn extend
  from the zopetoolkit cfg files. The newly created project will have an
  ``extends-cache`` directive set, in order to support "off-line" building (as
  long as no new packages are required for building).

  **NOTE: As a result of these structural changes, ``grokproject`` will no
  longer support building projects based on Grok versions earlier than 1.1.1
  (or earlier than 1.0.2, for the 1.0-line of Grok releases).**

* Remove the interactive debugger entry point in favor of a buildout part
  that generates a similar commandline tool for the newly created project.

* Use the zpassword functionality for the bin/zpasswd tool.

* No longer build the zdaemon ctl.

* Projects created will use the #main and #debug entry points now defined
  in grokcore.startup.

* The application specific version pins are now in Grok's versions cfg.

* Remove '--zopectl' option. Paster setups are now the only supported
  method to create new projects.
  Fix bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/524262

1.0.3 (2010-02-21)
------------------

* Fix bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/524000
  Firsttime-user problem on win32: grokproject didn't work if no
  .buildout/default.cfg existed and user had no pywin32 already installed.

* Pin zope.app.container 3.8.1 and zope.app.folder 3.5.1 for project
  created with Grok 1.1a2 KGS (those packages were not pinned in the released
  versions.cfg).

* For Python 2.5 and 2.6, use hashlib module instead of the deprecated
  sha module in Python 2.6.

* Use bugfixed grokui.admin 0.4.1.

1.0.2 (2010-02-14)
------------------

* Added license file.

1.0.1 (2010-01-24)
------------------

* Fix bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/487561 Granted
  ``zope.View`` and ``zope.app.dublincore.view`` permissions for all
  users (also authenticated ones) in site.zcml and ftesting.zcml
  templates.

* Pinned down zc.zope3recipes for zopectl-driven installs. The more
  recent versions of zc.zope3recipes require zc.recipe.egg >= 1.2.0
  which we currently do not support. As a result zctl-builds could
  fail due to unmet version constraints.


1.0 (2009-10-07)
----------------

* The ``debug.ini`` file now by default configures the Unuathorized
  exception to not to be reraised. This will make sure Zope's authentication
  mechanism keep working when using the ``z3c.evalexception`` middleware.


1.0b1 (2009-09-17)
------------------

* The var/ directory is now used for var/filestorage, var/blobstorage and
  var/log instead of storing all that in the parts/ directory.  This matches
  expectations of most users: parts/ can be rebuild, var/ must be backed up.

* Added blob-storage in paster template's `zope.conf.in`. Blob-storage
  is enabled by default.

* Removed ``find-links`` from `buildout.cfg`.

* Added two packages to the pinned versions in generated projects:
  z3c.recipe.dev = 0.5.3
  zc.lockfile = 1.0.0

* Using the just released z3c.recipe.eggbasket 0.4.3 in the generated
  projects.

* Increased z3c.recipe.i18n version to use: 0.5.3 does not emit any
  warnings any more when being installed.

* Assert that project names are valid python identifiers
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/223560
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/373592

* Generate the site.zcml containing the new default permission for grok.
  grok.View is now the default view instead of zope.Public.

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/387332


1.0a4 (2009-04-17)
------------------

* Fixed wrong site-definition path in generated zope.conf.

* Fix bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/358719
  Backslashes in Windows paths are now quoted in Python expressions in
  configuration .ini files. Patches, testing and solutions from Ben
  Dadsetan and Roger Erens.

* Add filter to include only eggs in generated versions.cfg that are
  not already provided by a downloaded grok KGS.

* Reintroduce ``find-links`` to Zope package index in generated
  buildout.cfg to avoid problems with z3c.widget and other packages
  needing packages only hosted on Zope.

* Removed `grokui.admin` from generated versions.cfg. It should be
  pinned down by Groks versions.cfg.


1.0a3 (2009-04-03)
------------------

* Fix bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/315223
  The eggs-directory path that we put in ~/.buildout/default.cfg is
  now a shortened version on Windows (8.3 DOS style).

* Fix bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/160196 The initial
  password is now stored SHA1 encoded.

* Make the `zope.app.server.zpasswd` utility available as a
  commandline tool in bin/.

* Fix bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/325299 The config files
  in paster-based grok projects are now generated by ``zc.buildout``
  in the new location ``parts/etc/`` and can be adjusted to local
  environments. Rerunning ``bin/buildout`` now rebuilds the
  configuration files in ``parts/etc/`` from the templates that can be
  found in ``etc/``.

  To start paster you now have to do::

    $ bin/paster serve parts/etc/deploy.ini

* Fix bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/315214 by supporting
  faster test runs. See README-shorttests.txt for details.

* Pinned all package versions in the generated versions.cfg to the
  latest released ones.  Especially pinned z3c.recipe.eggbasket to
  the most recent one, 0.4.1.

* Integrated with grokcore.startup
  Removed ``startup.py`` from the paster template

* Paster: you need to first access http://localhost:8080/@@login.html
  when running the debug.ini profile

* Fix bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/332173
  add middleware to support access logging

1.0a2 (2009-01-12)
------------------

* Add option ``--grokversion`` which installs the requested version of
  Grok with the created project. Examples::

    grokproject --grokversion=0.14.1 Sample

  or::

    paster create -t grok Sample grokversion=0.14.1

* Add option ``--version`` to show grokproject version and stay
  compatible with most command-line tools.

* Fix bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/315795 paster variant
  of grokproject now again accepts projectnames with uppercase chars.

1.0a1 (2009-01-08)
------------------

* Fixed bug: using the ``--svn-repository`` option would fail with an
  OSError.

* Add another template set for paster support

* Add option --zopectl to select 'zopectl' templates

* Make 'paster' the default template set

0.9 (2008-09-29)
----------------

* Add grokui.admin as a dependency for projects created with grokproject.

* Respect the verboseness requested by the user when running the final
  install.

* Fix behaviour that produced double/triple output when `buildout`
  was invoked several times.

* grokproject now uses `z3c.recipe.i18n` instead of `lovely.recipe`
  for generation of i18n-scripts.

* At the end of the bootstrap.py of the generated project we now give
  the user a hint that he can run bin/buildout.

* Explicitly run the install of the eggbasket recipe.

* Fix ftesting.zcml to not include grok package : it precludes overrides of
  anything included by grok.

0.8 (2008-07-14)
----------------

* Pinned zc.buildout and the used recipes in the generated
  versions.cfg.

* Check for download errors when getting the release info files from
  grok.zope.org.  That way we give a meaningful error message to the
  user.

* Removed dependency on zc.buildout as we already use
  bootstrap.py-like code to install it on the fly if it is not there
  yet.

* Removed code that was factored out into z3c.recipe.eggbasket and
  already gets invoked by grokproject by doing a "buildout bootstrap".

* Actually added the required eggbasket section to the generated
  buildout.cfg.  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/242368

* Catch download error when trying to get the big grok tarball.

* Use a hardcoded bootstrap.py instead of referring to it via an
  external or downloading the current trunk revision upon each
  grokproject run (those options are potentially dangerous).

  Also added a line at the end of bootstrap.py to install the
  eggbasket section.

* Added a testbrowser test / functional test to the template.

* Added a dependency on z3c.testsetup for created projects.

* Factor out functions is_grok_installed and install_grok.

* When grok is not installed yet, download a tar ball with all eggs
  needed by Grok and install those in the shared eggs directory.

* If the user has a ~/.buildout/default.cfg nothing is added to the
  created buildout.cfg. If there is no default.cfg one is created
  with a line specifying the eggs-directory to ~/.buildout/eggs. If
  the user specified --eggs-dir/eggs_dir on the command line that
  will be added to buildout.cfg.

* When there is no .buildout/default.cfg file, create it.  Only put
  eggs-directory in the created buildout.cfg file when the user does
  not have it in default.cfg yet.

* Do not ask for eggs dir when we have a default already.

* Refactor grokproject/__init__.py by moving things out into main.py,
  templates.py and utils.py, like zopeproject does.

* Add README.txt file to the created static/ dir.  Biggest reason:
  otherwise 'python setup.py sdist' simply does not add that empty
  directory.

* Added local download of the current fixed versions as versions.cfg.

* Add handling for the eggs-directory option in buildout.cfg, taken
  from zopeproject.

* Added a test for grokproject itself.

* Copy the run_buildout function from zopeproject and put it in
  utils.py.  Call that in the post hook of our paste template.  In the
  grokproject command after calling paster just quit.

* Do checks before asking questions.  Define getters for some vars.
  Move no_buildout from the command to run_buildout in the template.
  Use version_info_url in the template instead of renaming it to
  extends.

* Remove the --newer option for bin/grokproject.  Use the 'newest'
  option from the template instead.

* Move version_info_url to the template vars without making it a real
  question.

* Rename the grokproject template to just grok.  ME GROK LIKE SHORT NAMES.

* Do not add eggs-directory to the buildout.cfg, as the absolute paths
  created make the resulting project unusable on other computers.

* "bin/paster create -t grokproject" now works again.

* Make sure bin/paster gets added so we can also test only our
  paster template instead of the command.

* Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/223247: grokproject
  generates faulty ftesting.zcml. Replaced
  zope.app.securitypolicy.zopepolicy.ZopeSecurityPolicy with
  zope.securitypolicy.zopepolicy.ZopeSecurityPolicy in ftesting.zcml
  template (Depends on a Grok release > 0.11.1).

0.7 (2008-04-22)
----------------

* Each of the interactive questions can now be set with an commandline
  option.

* No longer ask for the name of the module that will contain the
  grok.Application subclass.  It's 'app.py' by default now, a rename
  is easy enough to do later on.

* Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/161947: The buildout.cfg
  template contained the [data] section twice.

* Generate ``<includeDependencies package="." />`` statement by default. If
  new dependencies are added to ``setup.py`` that need ZCML, the ZCML
  will be automatically loaded. (Depends on a new release of Grok with
  z3c.autoinclude)

0.6 (2007-10-10)
----------------

* Added include package directive to ftesting.zcml_tmpl to enable functional
  testing of the generated application.

* Updated template for site.zcml, no annoying warning at start.

* Added buildout support for i18n (thanks to lovely.recipe.i18n).

* The buildout.cfg that is created now has an extends directive that points
  to URL of the version.cfg of the current Grok release. This URL can be
  overridden with the --version-info-url commandline option.

  See http://grok.zope.org/releaseinfo/readme.html for more information.

0.5.1 (2007-07-14)
------------------

* Use the new 'application' recipe from zc.zope3recipes so that we can
  get rid of the dead chicken [zope3] section in buildout.cfg.

0.5 (2007-07-14)
----------------

* The bin/instance script has been renamed to bin/zopectl for better
  recognizability.

* grokproject is much quieter by default (by quieting down
  PasteScript, easy_install and zc.buildout).  Use the -v option for
  verbose mode.

* Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/119805:
  A new project created with grokproject can't be called 'grok' or 'zope'.

* By default, zc.buildout will now be told to place eggs in a
  user-specified shared eggs directory.  Also, it will not look for
  newer versions of existing eggs by default.

0.4 (2007-07-12)
----------------

* As grok now depends on Zope 3.4 eggs, use zc.zope3recipes
  application and instance recipes.

* Don't spawn processes to bootstrap and run the buildout.  Instead,
  try to simply import zc.buildout.  If that doesn't work, call the
  setuptools API to install it and then simply import it.

* Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/113103:
  Default index template was missing closing html tag.

0.1 thru 0.3
------------

Initial development versions, supporting Zope 3.3.
