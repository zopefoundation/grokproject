Changes
=======

0.8 (unreleased)
------------------

* Temporarily added find-links again as it is needed to find zope.tal
  3.4.0b1 which was never released on the cheeseshop.

* Add a testbrowser test.

* Set up a functional test.

* Added a dependency on z3c.testsetup for created projects.

* Factor out functions is_grok_installed and install_grok.

* When grok is not installed yet, download a tar ball with all eggs
  needed by Grok and install those in the shared eggs directory.

* Added svn:external for bootstrap/bootstrap.py to the buildout. And we're
  downloading a fresh one for every grokproject that we're generating.

* Add newest=false to the buildout.cfg of grokproject itself.

* If the user has a ~/.buildout/default.cfg nothing is added to the
  created buildout.cfg. If there is no default.cfg one is created
  with a line specifying the eggs-directory to ~/.buildout/eggs. If
  the user specified --eggs-dir/eggs_dir on the command line that
  will be added to buildout.cfg.

* When there is no .buildout/default.cfg file, create it.  Only put
  eggs-directory in the created buildout.cfg file when the user does
  not have it in default.cfg yet.

* Do not ask for eggs dir when we have a default already.

* Refactor grokproject/__init__.py by moving things out into main.py,
  templates,py and utils.py, like zopeproject does.

* Add README.txt file to the created static/ dir.  Biggest reason:
  otherwise 'python setup.py sdist' simply does not add that empty
  directory.

* Added local download of the current fixed versions as versions.cfg.

* Add bin/test

* Add handling for the eggs-directory option in buildout.cfg, taken
  from zopeproject.

* Added test.

* Copy the run_buildout function from zopeproject and put it in
  utils.py.  Call that in the post hook of our paste template.  In the
  grokproject command after calling paster just quit.

* Do checks before asking questions.  Define getters for some vars.
  Move no_buildout from the command to run_buildout in the template.
  Use version_info_url in the template instead of renaming it to
  extends.

* Remove the --newer option for bin/grokproject.  Use the 'newest'
  option from the template instead.

* Move version_info_url to the template vars without making it a real
  question.

* Rename the grokproject template to just grok.  Me Grok Like Short Names.

* Do not add eggs-directory to the buildout.cfg, as the absolute paths
  created make the resulting project unusable on other computers.

* "bin/paster create -t grokproject" now works again.

* Make sure bin/paster gets added so we can also test only our
  paster template instead of the command.

* Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/223247: grokproject
  generates faulty ftesting.zcml. Replaced
  zope.app.securitypolicy.zopepolicy.ZopeSecurityPolicy with
  zope.securitypolicy.zopepolicy.ZopeSecurityPolicy in ftesting.zcml
  template (Depends on a Grok release > 0.11.1).


0.7 (2008-04-22)
------------------

* Each of the interactive questions can now be set with an commandline
  option.

* No longer ask for the name of the module that will contain the
  grok.Application subclass.  It's 'app.py' by default now, a rename
  is easy enough to do later on.

* Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/161947: The buildout.cfg
  template contained the [data] section twice.

* Generate ``<includeDependencies package="." />`` statement by default. If
  new dependencies are added to ``setup.py`` that need ZCML, the ZCML
  will be automatically loaded. (Depends on a new release of Grok with
  z3c.autoinclude)


0.6 (2007-10-10)
----------------

* Added include package directive to ftesting.zcml_tmpl to enable functional
  testing of the generated application.

* Updated template for site.zcml, no annoying warning at start.

* Added buildout support for i18n (thanks to lovely.recipe.i18n).

* The buildout.cfg that is created now has an extends directive that points
  to URL of the version.cfg of the current Grok release. This URL can be
  overridden with the --version-info-url commandline option.

  See http://grok.zope.org/releaseinfo/readme.html for more information.

0.5.1 (2007-07-14)
------------------

* Use the new 'application' recipe from zc.zope3recipes so that we can
  get rid of the dead chicken [zope3] section in buildout.cfg.

0.5 (2007-07-14)
----------------

* The bin/instance script has been renamed to bin/zopectl for better
  recognizability.

* grokproject is much quieter by default (by quieting down
  PasteScript, easy_install and zc.buildout).  Use the -v option for
  verbose mode.

* Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/119805:
  A new project created with grokproject can't be called 'grok' or 'zope'.

* By default, zc.buildout will now be told to place eggs in a
  user-specified shared eggs directory.  Also, it will not look for
  newer versions of existing eggs by default.

0.4 (2007-07-12)
----------------

* As grok now depends on Zope 3.4 eggs, use zc.zope3recipes
  application and instance recipes.

* Don't spawn processes to bootstrap and run the buildout.  Instead,
  try to simply import zc.buildout.  If that doesn't work, call the
  setuptools API to install it and then simply import it.

* Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/113103:
  Default index template was missing closing html tag.

0.1 thru 0.3
------------

Initial development versions, supporting Zope 3.3.
