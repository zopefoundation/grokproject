* get a better zope3instance recipe that places a startup script in
  the top-level bin directory (so you won't have to reach into
  parts/instance/bin)

* silence buildout output and be more informative on the other hand

* proper arguments parsing (support --help, etc.)

* support svn sandbox creation
