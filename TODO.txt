* zc.buildout has a logging initialization bug (it doesn't tear down
  the logging handler, so subsequent logging calls are multiplied).
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/125729.

* generate a buildout.cfg with
  - eggs-directory = ...
  - newest = false
* Allow values to be provided thru command line arguments
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/125817.

* Update to newer zc.zope3recipes that doesn't need [zope3] section
